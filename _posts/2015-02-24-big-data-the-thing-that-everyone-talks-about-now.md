Provocation 2: One of the traps that people often fall into is linking correlation with causation. Thinking about this reminds me of a few examples of riciculous graphs that shows correlation is not causation including this one:![correlation_vs_causation.png]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/correlation_vs_causation.png)


To avoid mistakes like this, it is extremely important for researchers to understand the context of the data and choose the appropriate interpretation approach. Of course it is important to have "good data", but the analysis is in fact more important in this case. Using the appropriate way to approach the data analysis also governs how the data should be cleaned. Therefore, researchers should not believe that simply acquiring more data will yield better analysis.

Provacation 5: Who can access what kind of data has been a huge issue recently. Not long ago, it was revealed that Facebook altered Newsfeed contents to conduct studies without informing the users. They were allowed to do this because of the loopholes in their privacy statements that no one reads. Essentially the public had no way of knowing what kind of information Facebook is studying or altering. Social media websites like Facebook essentially are blessed with an enormous amount of data that enables them to conduct different kinds of studies. Is it ethical to do what they are doing though? Should law makers attempt to help the customers by restricting on big data usage? As the companies like Facebook aquire more and more data in the future, it is urgent for the society to figure out how to treat privacy in the Big Data era and determine what are the right ways to use the data.
