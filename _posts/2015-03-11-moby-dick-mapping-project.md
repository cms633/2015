This is more of a concept than an implementation since I'm not sure how to actually implement this in a web environment. It is definitely interesting to see how the story would change if it's set in a different time period. My concept is to allow the users to select which year they would like to set the stories, and the map will highlight the most searched events and locations in that time period. The map of the original map will be overlayed onto the selected time period. Therefore, people will be able to get a feel of how the whale searching will be different if the story was set in a different time. 

The outcome of this will allow people to get a feel of the important events of each time period as well as how it could affect the same kind of activities. This can be extrapolated to other activities and see how the change of the society can affect human interaction and experience. Below is a rough similated image of how I envision it to look
