Inspired by the Urban Libraries Council reading, I visited two of the three Cambridge Public Libraries. The first was the Central Square Branch of the Cambridge Public Library System. The second was the Main Cambridge Public Library. 

The demographics of the Central Square Branch are varied widely (intending to serve the entire community). On a Monday afternoon, there were pre-teens hanging out, older homeless people resting and reading, non-native English speaking adults working in the Literacy Program, and college students enjoying the quiet and the Wifi.   It was a rather intimate space, warm with brick and wood furniture (so intimate I was uncomfortable taking pictures).

The demographics of the Cambridge Branch were completely different. On the same Monday afternoon, there were nannies watching their children, and college students snacking in the caf√© and using their Mac computers with hipster-looking adults. It was very lively for a library. The space was grand and open, full of light and glass. Some places were roped off with velvet rope and the community room remained mysteriously locked. Although an awesome resource, I found the space intimidating. 

The Central Square Branch lends out Nooks preloaded with books (a practice common to all Cambridge libraries). The library also had computers in the Literacy Project space, catalog computers, and a computer lab. I saw all of these technologies used, except for the Nooks. 

The main library had a lot more technology. In addition to the common library technologies, large monitors acted as bulletin boards (with information ranging from transit congestion to calendars of library activities). There were also machines for accessible reading and printing (a braille machine and magnifying readers). In addition, there was an amazing upright scanner in the archives. I loved the open access to unusual resources.

However, neither library really capitalized fully on innovative uses of technology to foster social interaction or discoverability of library resources.
