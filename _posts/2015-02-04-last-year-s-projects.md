These three DH projects were completed by student teams for last year's iteration of CMS.633.

**Around the World**

Around the World—created by Parul Batra, Christian Landeros and Bethany LaPenta—uses an array of realtime analysis tools to construct an augmented record of contemporary news media across the globe. Read the group's design brief [here]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/Around_The_World.pdf).

**Art Annotator**

For their final project, Megan Gebhard, Eric Fisher Jepsen and Evan Moore conceived and prototyped a platform for adding a community layer to art museum experiences. Their project uses annotation technology to expand the modes of interaction available to art historians and other viewers.

**Arttract**

Ari Vogel, Dohyun Bae and Nick Nigam also turned their attention toward augmenting the art museum experience: their project allows users to cement what might otherwise be fleeting encounters with art by drawing these viewings into a process of documentation and curation.
